# Artifact Appendix
### Abstract
This artifact contains the code and script to generate compression-ratio and throughput results for the 4 algorithms the paper introduces. The results should be similar to the numbers shown in Figures 8 through 19 for SPratio, SPspeed, DPratio, and DPspeed, that is, the compression ratios should match exactly but the compression and decompression throughputs are system dependent.

### Description
###### How to access
The artifact can be found at https://github.com/noushinAzami/LosslessFP.

###### Hardware dependencies
The hardware required for this artifact is an x86 multi-core CPU and a CUDA-capable GPU. We used a 32-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R CPU @ 2.9 GHz with hyperthreading enabled to run the CPU codes. To run the GPU codes, we used an NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti. Using similar hardware should result in throughputs similar to those reported in the paper.

###### Software dependencies
The required software includes:
- The computational artifact from https://github.com/noushinAzami/LosslessFP
- GCC 7.5.0 or higher
- OpenMP 3.1 or higher
- CUDA 11.0 or higher
- Python v3.4 or higher
- Matplotlib v3.6 or higher


###### Data sets
The data sets used in the artifact are downloaded as part of the installation process and can be found at https://sdrbench.github.io.

###### Installation
To install the artifact
- Clone artifact repository from https://github.com/noushinAzami/LosslessFP
- Run 'compile.py' to compile SPratio, SPspeed, DPratio, and DPspeed

###### Experiment workflow
1. Clone artifact repository from https://github.com/noushinAzami/LosslessFP
2. Run ‘get\_inputs\_\{double, single\}.py’ to collect the inputs used by the artifact
3. Run 'compile.py' to compile SPratio, SPspeed, DPratio, and DPspeed
4. Run ‘run\_experiments\_\{double, single\}.py’ to produce the intermediate experimental output
5. Run ‘chart\_\{double, single\}.py’ to produce compression and decompression charts that look like Figures 8 through 19 but without the results for the third-party codes.
6. View the charts which are in the root directory named 'double_charts.png' and 'single_charts.png'

###### Evaluation and expected results

The evaluation of the results is accomplished by comparing the result figures generated using this artifact to the SPratio, SPspeed, DPratio, and DPspeed results listed in Figures 8 through 19. The absolute values of the throughputs and the relative positions may be different based on the CPU and GPU used, but the compression ratios should be the same.
